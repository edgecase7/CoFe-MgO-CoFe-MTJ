# CoFe---MgO---CoFe-MTJ
This project implements a complete atomistic simulation of a CoFe/MgO/CoFe Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ), a critical component in Spintronics and STT-MRAM technology. The simulation is performed using QuantumATK (LCAO-DFT) and analyzes the Tunneling Magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in the "clean limit" of crystalline transport.
